# OpenCVLearning
This is where I will put the fruits of my labour while learning the OpenCV python package

The first file is my attempt at completing the exercise in the OpenCV tutorial that requires you to make a basic paint application.
This paint application allows you to change the colour of the paint as well as the size of the brush.
I will work on the ability to stop painting, it seems as though the mouse will keep on painting, even if I am not holding down the left button.
